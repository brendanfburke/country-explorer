# Country Explorer


## A one stop shop for gathering useful information about the countries of the World


### Description

This website serves as an easy to navigate resource for anyone looking to learn about any country they may be curious about. A user can look up a country alphabetically, by continent, peruse the colorful flags, or search for a country by name. The site conveniently features a Google maps integration for further exploration of any region that the user may find themselves in.

### Technologies Used

This site was built using React, CSS, HTML, [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/), and the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps).

 
### Deployed Site 

You can visit [Country Explorer](https://country-explorer-brendan-burke.netlify.app/) to try it out for yourself!

### Installation Guidelines

If you wish to download the source code for this application and modify it for your own use, feel free to fork and clone it down to your own machine. Run 'npm i' to install the various dependencies that I used. You will need to register with Google Developers for your own maps API key, which will need to be stored in a secured .env file. Rest countries, very generously, does not require authorization to access their API. 

### Contribution Guidelines

I am very open to collaboration on this project, so please feel free to reach out if you have any ideas about the direction that this project should take in the future. If you'd like to write your own code, please make a pull request on my main repo with a detailed comment providing the details of your commit.
